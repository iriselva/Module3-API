## Plant website: My Leaf

Welcome to my Module3 API assignment. I made a plant website where you can learn plant names and add them to your favorites! This is a single page application where I use local storage to save the favorites.

> + Press the Heart button underneath the plants that you like
> + Go to the page: Favorites
> + If you want to remove a plant from your favorites list, press the X button
